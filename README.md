## !rules overview
This game is based on a game from the korean reality/game show 
The Genius.  
Each player is imagined to be sitting in a circle, on seats named 
from A, B, C, and so on.  
Each seat is adjacent to two other seats, wrapping around at the 
beginning and end.  
Every player is also assigned a secret number, from 0 up to the number 
of players-1.  
The game ends when a specific amount of players, depending on the total 
number of players, is seated such that their secret numbers are in 
increasing or decreasing order. In game parlance this is called a 
"Streak"  
Players start with a number of so-called "garnets", which is the 
currency as well as the ultimate objective, where the players with 
the most garnets win.  
Being part of the streak that finishes the game will handsomely 
reward you with garnets.  
There is also one number assigned to be **X**, which changes each 
round. X cannot form any streaks, and if the game ends while 
you\'re X you will lose garnets.
Once each round you may swap seats with another player, this is made 
by sending them a "proposal", which they have to accept.  
See the sections listed under `!rules index` for more detailed rules.
